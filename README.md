# Message Funnel

***Work on a summer internship at SimbirSoft at the end of the second year of university.***

So. Suppose you have several chatbots in different messengers.
You may be too lazy to go into each of them to respond to end users.
That's exactly the problem our app solves.

There's a main bot, there's a set of dependent bots.
The owner sits on the main bot, reading and responding to the messages sent to him by the dependent bots.

At the moment, the main bot is the Discord Bot and the dependent bot is Telegram.

The part for communication between bots is implemented through Java Sockets and was done by [OneWayDream](https://github.com/OneWayDream).

The main part related to the Discord bot was done by [me](https://github.com/nasibullin-erik).

The main part related to the Telegram bot was done by [KoaLa1101](https://github.com/KoaLa1101)
